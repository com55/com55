# Hi there, I'm com55 👋

> *Just an independent, self-taught coder exploring whatever looks interesting.*

## About Me

- **Amateur Coder:** I enjoy coding freely, learning as I go. No pressure, just curiosity!
- **Languages I Use:**
  - Mostly Python 🐍 (Not advanced, but learning more every day)
  - Can write basic stuff in C, JavaScript, VB, and more.
- **Philosophy:**  
  - I love tinkering, experimenting, and picking up new things—especially projects that make life a bit better (Quality of Life, QoL).

## 🚀 What I Like to Build

- Anything that sparks my interest!
- Usually small QoL tools, scripts, or utilities.
- I believe in learning by doing—so you'll find a variety of experimental stuff here.

## 🌱 Currently

- Exploring Python's endless possibilities
- Occasionally dabbling with other languages for fun
- Always on the lookout for new ideas and challenges

## ✨ Fun Fact

I rarely stick to just one type of project—if it looks fun or useful, I'll give it a shot!
